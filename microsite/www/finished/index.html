        <h2>Uncyclopedia: The Content-Free Encyclopedia</h2>
        <img class="potato" src="images/potato-globe.png" alt="potato-globe">
        <div class="intro">
        <div> Uncyclopedia is a website that 
            parodies Wikipedia. Its logo, a 
            hollow “puzzle potato”, parodies 
            Wikipedia’s globe puzzle logo,and 
            it styles itself “the content-free 
            encyclopedia”, parodying 
            Wikipedia’s slogan of “the free 
            encyclopedia.” Founded in 2005 
            as an English-language wiki, the 
            project spans over 75 languages 
            as well as several subprojects 
            parodying other wikis. The English 
            version has approximately 35,000 
            pages of content, second only to 
            the Portuguese.
            
            Various styles of humor are used 
            as a vehicle for parody, from 
            pointed satire to light sarcasm, 
            along with structured in-jokes and 
            frequent non sequiturs.</div>

            <div>The site has attracted media attention for
            its articles on controversial
            subjects including religion,
            prominent people, places, politics,
            and pseudoscience.
            
            Many Uncyclopedia articles
            contain graphics with a link to the corresponding Wikipedia article. A typical caption reads, "For those without comedic tastes, the so-called experts at Wikipedia think they have an article about [subject in question]." Some also have a link to the corresponding Conservapedia article. A typical caption for one of these is "The
            faux patriot snake handlers at Conservapedia have an even funnier article about [subject in
            question]".</div>

                <aside>Co-founder of Uncyclopedia, Jonathan Huang, maybe. Idk… That guy’s pretty mysterious.</aside>
                <h3>History</h3>
                <div>Uncyclopedia was launched on January 5, 2005, by Jonathan Huang, known online as “Chronarion”, and a partner known online as “Stillwaters”. In July 2006, it was acquired by Wikia.

                January 2013, some Uncyclopedia editors and administrators set up a fork of Uncyclopedia at en.uncyclopedia.co, in response to Wikia’s censorship, insertion of advertising, and the imposition of content warnings. Fandom later ceased hosting its version of Uncyclopedia on May 14, 2019, and the site moved to a new domain which was created at uncyclopedia.ca.
                    
                A third site, at mirror.uncyc.org, functions only as a mirror website with backup copies of some Uncyclopedia pages.</div>

                <img src="images/potato.jpg" alt="potato">
                <aside>According to Uncyclopedia’s page on… Uncyclopedia, the potato symbolizes mental softness and dead Irishmen.</aside>
                <h3>Structure</h3>
                <div>Uncyclopedia is built on the same MediaWiki software that Wikipedia uses. However, Fandom extensively modified its version of MediaWiki, making the Fandom Uncyclopedia site incompatible with later MediaWiki versions. In May 2018, Fandom dropped support for the Monobook skin that its Uncyclopedia site had used to mimic Wikipedia, claiming this was necessary to achieve GDPR compliance, and warned that local work-arounds could not be extended to new visitors and editors by default.

                In 2007, 25% (or 20 out of 34) of the Uncyclopedia collection was hosted by Wikia. Six dedicated non-Wikia servers host “Uncyclopedia Babel” content in various languages. To coordinate these projects (collectively, the “Uncyclomedia Babel Project”) an Un-Meta wiki was created in 2006.
                    
                Uncyclopedia projects are run independently by their own members. They contain interlanguage links to each other, but there is no global governing organization comparable to the Wikimedia Foundation that oversees Wikipedia as well as its sister projects.</div>

                <h3>Content</h3>
                <h4 class="article">Article</h4>
                <div>Uncyclopedia encourages satire that is close to or resembles the truth. However, many articles employ absurdist humor and little, if any, factual accuracy remains. 

                Uncyclopedia's articles often begin with quotations, usually misquoted, fictitiously attributed or entirely fabricated. Among the most recurrent themes is the invention of quotes attributed to Oscar Wilde, prompted by an article stating that inventing Wilde quotes was the "national sport of England", and themes such as "kitten huffing" (the inhalation of the souls of cats as a form of drug abuse).
                    
                Much like Wikipedia, Uncyclopedia has policies concerning vanity articles, which are articles written by an individual associated with the subject of the page. Vanity articles were disallowed after many of them produced flame wars. Uncyclopedia does not police conflict of interest but may delete submissions as non-notable on a case-by-case basis.

                <h4 class="traditions">Traditions</h4>
                <div>Each year, Uncyclopedia moderators create a list of 100 worst reflections of that year, sometimes marking milestones of that year, or simply news that had happened at that time. Most years the creators of the list reveal that they have once again put off the list until the last second, and simply skip a large chunk to get to 100 in time.</div>
                <h4>Subprojects</h4>
                <div>As well as housing many articles designed to satirize Wikipedia-style content, Uncyclopedia contains several secondary projects (known as “UnProjects”). As of 2017, there were 16 such projects, each of which specializes in parody of a different information style. Many of these are directly analogous to Wikipedia’s sister projects, while others such as UnTunes and HowTo parody projects completely unrelated to Wikipedia.</div>

                <h3>Press Coverage</h3>
                <div>Uncyclopedia has been referenced in several well-known news publications from around the world, in addition to numerous local and regional newspapers and periodicals. In 2005, the Flying Spaghetti Monster entry from Uncyclopedia was mentioned in a New York Times column reporting the spread of “Pastafarianism”, the religion that worships the Flying Spaghetti Monster. The column was then reprinted in other newspapers, including the Taipei Times.  A number of other articles have been centred on specific entries on Uncyclopedia—most notably the article in the Arizona Daily Star, which focused on the Tucson, Arizona parody, and the article in the Cyprus Mail, which focused on the Cyprus article.

                In addition to articles about specific entries on the wiki, several papers speak of the website in general. It has also been listed as one of the “Top 100 Undiscovered Web Sites” in PC Magazine, as well as among the “101 most useful websites” on the internet by The Sunday Telegraph. Seattle Post-Intelligencer considers Uncyclopedia to be the wiki site equivalent of The Onion.</div>

                <h3 class="criticism">Criticism</h3>
                <div>At various times, articles on Uncyclopedia have generated criticism from King’s College (School, Auckland) the North-West Evening Mail, Northern Irish politician James McCarry, civic leaders of Telford, Shropshire, UK, the Sioux City Journal, Hawke’s Bay Today, and Lochaber News.

                In January 2008, the Malaysian Internal Security Ministry issued a directive alerting newspaper editors not to trust Uncyclopedia. It said the article concerning Malaysia contained “untruths, insults and ridicule” and was demeaning to the country.
                    
                The site uses a layout that looks similar to that of Wikipedia, which may confuse inexperienced users that misinterpret the content as factual.
                    
                In November 2012, the page “HowTo:Commit suicide” on the Russian-language Uncyclopedia: Absurdopedia; was legally prohibited by the Russian Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Welfare (Rospotrebnadzor). </div>

                <div class="criticism-body">Absurdopedia administrator Edward Chernenko unsuccessfully sued them under his right to science and culture guaranteed by the Russian Constitution. During the proceedings, the Russian government and its experts claimed that Absurdopedia is intentionally trying to increase the number of child suicides in Russia by providing children with instructions for killing themselves. As of 2013 the case is currently in the ECHR.

                In 2014, the page “HowTo:Make a bomb at home” on Absurdopedia was included in the Russian list of extremist materials.
                    
                In 2017, two pages of Absurdopedia were banned in Russia: “HowTo:Bathe a cat” for “calls to violence against animals” and “HowTo:Make a nuclear bomb” for “information on manufacturing weapons”.
                    
                In August 2014, the logo displayed for Greggs on its Google profile was mistakenly temporarily switched to the logo used on Uncyclopedia's article on the subject at the Wikia site due to a caching issue, causing a PR crisis for the company.</div>
